Panmind Usage Tracker

what is it?
1. a rack-middleware sends selected parts of the request ennvironment to a socket,
2. where an eventmachine loop is waiting for data which will be
3. sent to a couchdb-database for storage/analysis

to deploy:
    * the middleware is loaded automatically
    * eventmachine: start it with this command:
      $ ruby extras/usage_tracker/reactor.rb <environment>
    * couchdb: it uses the already running couchdb instance (creates the database if it's not existing)


there is a test of the system, which is part of:
$ rake test:integration
remember to start a test-EventMachine-loop before the test:
  $ ruby extras/usage_tracker/reactor.rb test
and to set to true a boolean in settings.yml:
  :test_usage_tracking: true

configurations:
- TCP-socket where Event-machine is listening
- urls of the couchdb databases
- whether to run tests
